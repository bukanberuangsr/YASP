# YASP - Yet Another Start Page

## Description

YASP is my new attempt on creating a perfect browser start page. Silly reasoning, I know. But I take this as an opportunity to be productive since college finals has already finished.

> looks good right?

## Features

There is not a whole lot of features here, but here it is anyway:

1. Search stuff with duckduckgo
2. Nice gif that stares at you
3. links to click on
4. Responsive

Thats it btw. Maybe there's more in the future.
